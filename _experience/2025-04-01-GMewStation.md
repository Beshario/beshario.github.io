#### The Challenge

EV battery production was ramping fast. Vision systems were a bottleneck.

- Low throughput (~5 packs/shift)
- Fragile inspections leading to frequent downtime
- Operator loading errors
- Maintenance slowed by unclear alarms and HMI flows

---

#### Part 1: Maintenance & Factory Integration

Supported existing vision systems on the production floor — troubleshooting, optimizing, and connecting systems to factory infrastructure.

Key tasks:
- Debugged and stabilized inspection logic to reduce false rejects
- Improved PLC alarms and HMI workflows for faster fault isolation
- Connected vision systems to plant network and data logging

#### Part 2: New Inspection Station Delivery

Designed and delivered a complete engineering kit for a new vision inspection station.
