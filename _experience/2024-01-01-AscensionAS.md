#### The Project

Commissioned error-proofing inspection systems for GM's EV battery lines. Started at the ATS campus in Cambridge, Ontario for Factory Acceptance Testing, then deployed on-site in Mexico.

---

#### Factory Acceptance Test (FAT)

Custom-built and developed the camera system before deployment. Used Matrox cameras with Design Assistant software — a flowchart-based tool for programming inspection logic.

FAT setup validating inspection before shipment:

#### On-Site Installation

At Ramos Arizpe, Mexico, I oversaw hardware installation and verified delivered parts against ATS design specifications.

Key tasks:
- Supervised mounting and placement of all components
- Directed camera and lighting setup — adjusting angles, focus, and exposure
- Optimized inspection programs using dummy samples from GM
- Programmed web interface for on-the-fly parameter tuning

---

#### Troubleshooting

Resolved various field issues:
- Cameras restarting randomly due to power problems
- Inspection images not saving to camera computer
- Unreliable inspections after program updates

Also gained hands-on PLC and HMI experience integrating stack lights, barcode readers, and torque controllers.

#### Project Phases

Aligned work with plant milestones:
- **N1/N5:** Initial setup and verification
- **N30:** Refinement and pre-production prep
- **PPAP:** Validation to GM quality standards
- **Production:** Optimization for full automation

Result: 100% automated inspection system with minimal intervention.

#### Results

- Fully automated vision inspection system deployed
- Met all GM quality standards through PPAP
- Effective collaboration across Ascension, ATS, MTQ4, and GM teams
