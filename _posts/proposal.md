Location: Ingersoll
Timeline: Aug 2024 – Apr 2025

S — Situation

EV battery production ramping fast. Vision systems were a bottleneck.

Pain points:

Low throughput (≈ 5 packs / shift)

Fragile inspections → frequent downtime

Operator loading errors

Maintenance slowed by unclear alarms & HMI flows

T — Task

Improve inspection robustness and throughput while delivering production-ready stations that plant teams could maintain confidently.

A — Action

Vision optimization

Reworked inspection logic to tolerate real production variance

Tuned exposure, timing, and decision logic for stability at speed

Throughput + deployment

Delivered complete vision stations:

Camera, optics, lighting

PLC and HMI integration

Plant-ready documentation and handoff

Scaled throughput from 5 → 120 packs per shift

Downtime reduction

Added scope inspection stations for faster fault isolation

Implemented operator load error-proofing stations to catch mistakes early

Improved PLC alarms and HMI workflows to reduce maintenance friction

R — Result

🚀 Throughput increased 24×

📉 Fewer false stops and recoveries

🧰 Maintenance teams diagnosed issues faster

🏭 Line reliability improved during high-volume production

Extra (Optional Visual Section)

Engineering kits & layouts

Camera mounting frames

a bit too much. we can focus on: Designed and delivered engineering kits (cameras, lenses, fixtures, accessories, cables) for new inspection deployments. program prototype, (this can be envisioned as proof of concept -> kits delovery, plant maintanace had execustion rights 

Got it — tighter, more focused, very visual. Here’s a minimal blog version that hits exactly that point.

What I Focused On

From prototype to plant-ready execution.

Designed and delivered engineering vision kits for new inspection deployments

Kits included:

Cameras & lenses

Lighting

Mechanical fixtures & mounts

Cables, routing, and accessories

How It Worked

Prototype → Kit → Plant execution

Built and validated a proof-of-concept inspection

Locked optics, lighting, timing, and mounting strategy

Packaged everything into a repeatable engineering kit

Delivered to plant maintenance teams

Maintenance owned execution

Vision intent and constraints were preserved

Why This Mattered

Faster deployment of new inspection stations

Fewer integration mistakes on the floor

Clear ownership between engineering and maintenance

Reduced downtime during rollout
